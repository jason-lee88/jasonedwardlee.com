                <p> Hello! My name is Jason Lee and I'm currently a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA studying computer science.<br><br>
                    At Lehigh, I've been involved with many campus organizations such as being the Founder and President of the Lehigh Tea Club, Secretary for Residence Hall Council, Ambassador for Lehigh After Dark. I am also a work-study employee through the university as a Lab Monitor for the Computer Science & Engineering Deptartment.<br><br>
                    Previously, I grew up in Stroudsburg, PA and graduated from Stroudsburg High School in 2018.
                    During my time in high school, I explored many activities and programs the school offered such as being the President of the Science Olympiad team, Future Business Leaders of America, Band, Environmental Club, and the Chess Team.
                    Additionally, I have worked in retail with Best Buy, Five Below, and volunteered at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Pocono.<br><br>
                    In my free time aside from my schoolwork, I enjoy experimenting with programming, listening to music, playing video and board games, and enjoying life to its fullest.<br><br>
                    Ultimately in life, my goal is to positively impact the world in as many ways as I can both emotionally and technologically.
                </p>
